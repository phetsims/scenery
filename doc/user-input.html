    <h2>Adding Input Handling to a Scene</h2>

    <p>
      <a href="./#scene">Scenes</a> do not have event listeners attached by default. To initialize the event system (that will attach and set up
      listeners),
      call <a href="./#scene-initializeEvents">scene.initializeEvents()</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accessibility related input listeners require a timer to work with assistive devices and to keep track of the
      state of the keyboard. In order for accessibility input to work correctly, call <code>axon.timer.emit( timeElapsedInSeconds )</code>
      prior to each call to <a href="./#display-updateDisplay">display.updateDisplay()</a>. <code>display.updateOnRequestAnimationFrame()</code> will do this for you. Take a look at <a href="accessibility.html">Accessibility in Scenery</a> for more information about accessibility.
    </p>

    <h2>Pointers</h2>

    <p>
      A <em>pointer</em> is an abstract way of describing a mouse, a single touch point, or a pen/stylus, similar to in the
      <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/pointerevents/raw-file/tip/pointerEvents.html">Pointer Events</a> specification. Touch and pen
      pointers are transient, created when the relevant DOM <em>down</em> event occurs and released when corresponding the DOM <em>up</em> or <em>cancel</em>
      event occurs. However, the mouse pointer is persistent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Input event listeners can be added to <a href="./#node">nodes</a> directly, or to a <a href="./#pointer">pointer</a> or the
      <a href="./#display">Display</a>. When a DOM event
      is received, it is first broken up into multiple events (if necessary, e.g. multiple touch points), then the dispatch is handled for
      each individual Scenery <a href="./#event">event</a>. Events are first fired for any listeners attached to the pointer that caused the event,
      then fire on the node directly under the pointer, and if applicable, bubble up the graph to the Scene from which the event was triggered.
      Finally, listeners attached to the Display will be triggered.
      <strong>Events are not fired directly on nodes that are not under the pointer at the time of the event.</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Listeners and Events</h2>

    <p>
      Event listeners are added with <a href="./#node-addInputListener">node.addInputListener( listener )</a>,
      <a href="./#pointer-addInputListener">pointer.addInputListener( listener )</a> and
      <a href="./#display-addInputListener">display.addInputListener( listener )</a>. This listener can be an arbitrary object, and the listener will
      be
      triggered by calling <code>listener[eventType]( event )</code>, where <code>eventType</code> is one of the event types as described below, and
      <code>event</code> is a Scenery <a href="./#event">event</a> with the following properties:
    </p>

    <table class="table">
      <tr>
        <td><strong>trail</strong></td>
        <td>
          A <a href="./#trail">Trail</a> pointing to the node under the pointer.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>pointer</strong></td>
        <td>
          The <a href="./#pointer">Pointer</a> that triggered the event. Additional information about the mouse/touch/pen can be obtained from the
          pointer, for example <code>event.pointer.point</code>.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>type</strong></td>
        <td>
          The base type of the event (e.g. for touch down events, it will always just be "down").
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>domEvent</strong></td>
        <td>
          The underlying DOM event that triggered this Scenery event. The DOM event may correspond to multiple Scenery events, particularly for touch
          events.
          This could be a TouchEvent, PointerEvent, MouseEvent, MSPointerEvent, etc.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>target</strong></td>
        <td>
          The leaf-most <a href="./#node">Node</a> in the <a href="./#trail">Trail</a>.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>currentTarget</strong></td>
        <td>
          The <a href="./#node">Node</a> to which the listener being fired is attached, or null if the listener is being fired directly from a
          pointer.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Event Types</h2>

    <p>
      Scenery will fire the following base event types:
    </p>

    <table class="table">
      <tr>
        <td><strong>down</strong></td>
        <td>
          Triggered when a pointer is pressed down. Touch / pen pointers are created for each down event, and are active until an up/cancel event is
          sent.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>up</strong></td>
        <td>
          Triggered when a pointer is released normally. Touch / pen pointers will not have any more events associated with them after an up event.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>cancel</strong></td>
        <td>
          Triggered when a pointer is canceled abnormally. Touch / pen pointers will not have any more events associated with them after an up event.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>move</strong></td>
        <td>
          Triggered when a pointer moves.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>wheel</strong></td>
        <td>
          Triggered when the (mouse) wheel is scrolled. The associated pointer will have wheelDelta information.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>enter</strong></td>
        <td>
          Triggered when a pointer moves over a Node or one of its children. Does not bubble up. Mirrors behavior from
          the DOM <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-type-mouseenter">mouseenter</a>.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>exit</strong></td>
        <td>
          Triggered when a pointer moves out from over a Node or one of its children. Does not bubble up. Mirrors behavior from
          the DOM <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-type-mouseleave">mouseleave</a>.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>over</strong></td>
        <td>
          Triggered when a pointer moves over a Node (not including its children). Mirrors behavior from
          the DOM <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-type-mouseover">mouseover</a>.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>out</strong></td>
        <td>
          Triggered when a pointer moves out from over a Node (not including its children). Mirrors behavior from
          the DOM <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-type-mouseout">mouseout</a>.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>keydown</strong></td>
        <td>
          Triggered when a key is pressed down. Fires on the keyboard-focused node and bubbles down.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>keydown</strong></td>
        <td>
          Triggered when a key is released. Fires on the keyboard-focused node and bubbles down.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Before firing the base event type (for example, <code>move</code>), Scenery will also fire an event specific to the type of pointer.
      For mice, it will fire <code>mousemove</code>, for touch events it will fire <code>touchmove</code>, and for pen events it will
      fire <code>penmove</code>. Similarly, for any type of event, it will first fire pointerType+eventType, and then eventType.
    </p>

    <h2>Event Dispatch</h2>

    <p>
      Events have two methods that will cause early termination: <code>event.abort()</code> will cause no more listeners to be notified for this
      event,
      and <code>event.handle()</code> will allow the current level of listeners to be notified (all pointer listeners, or all listeners attached to
      the
      current node), but no more listeners after that level will fire. <code>handle</code> and <code>abort</code> are like
      <code>stopPropagation</code>,
      <code>stopImmediatePropagation</code> for DOM events, except they do not trigger those DOM methods on the underlying DOM event.
    </p>

    <p>
      Up/down/cancel events all happen separately, but for move events, a specific sequence of events occurs if the pointer changes the node it is
      over:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>The <strong>move</strong> event is fired (and bubbles).</li>
      <li>An <strong>out</strong> event is fired for the old topmost Node (and bubbles).</li>
      <li><strong>exit</strong> events are fired for all Nodes in the Trail hierarchy that are now not under the pointer, from the root-most to the
        leaf-most. Does not bubble.
      </li>
      <li><strong>enter</strong> events are fired for all Nodes in the Trail hierarchy that were not under the pointer (but now are), from the
        leaf-most to the root-most. Does not bubble.
      </li>
      <li>An <strong>over</strong> event is fired for the new topmost Node (and bubbles).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      <code>event.abort()</code> and <code>event.handle()</code> will currently not affect other stages in the 'move' sequence
      (e.g. event.abort() in the 'move' event will not affect the following 'out' event).
    </p>

    <p>
      For each event type:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Listeners on the pointer will be triggered first (in the order they were added)</li>
      <li>Listeners on the target (top-most) Node will be triggered (in the order they were added to that Node)</li>
      <li>
        Then if the event bubbles, each Node in the Trail will be triggered, starting from the Node under the top-most (that just had listeners
        triggered)
        and all the way down to the Scene. Listeners are triggered in the order they were added for each Node.
      </li>
      <li>Listeners on the display will be triggered (in the order they were added)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      For each listener being notified, it will fire the more specific pointerType+eventType first (e.g. 'mousemove'), then eventType next (e.g.
      'move').
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, <code>preventDefault()</code> is called on the associated DOM event if the top-most node has the 'interactive' property set to a
      truthy value.
