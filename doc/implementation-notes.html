      NOTE: Currently a rough draft and collection of notes!
    </p>

    <h2>Instances</h2>

    <p>
      Scenery's nodes can form a DAG (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic
      graph</a>) in any manner. A <a href="../doc#display">Display</a> is attached to a single
      <em>root</em> <a href="../doc#node">Node</a>, and only displays the sub-graph rooted at that node. Since a
      node and its sub-graph can be shown in multiple places in the same display (and Scenery usually needs to
      treat them separately),
      we internally create an <strong>Instance tree</strong>, where an <a href="../doc#instance">Instance</a>
      refers to a
      particular copy of a node, with a specific path (sequence of <a href="../doc#node">Nodes</a>) from the root to
      the node. This sequence of nodes is referred to as a <a href="../doc#trail">Trail</a>. The Instance tree is
      conceptually constructed from a depth-first traversal of the node sub-graph, which essentially duplicates
      sub-graphs from nodes with multiple parents.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is one exception for Instance trees: there are cases where we want to duplicate a very commonly used
      Node, but we render it to an intermediate shared raster (Canvas/WebGL <em>cache</em>),
      and we don't want its
      children have the overhead of having many Instances. In this case, we'll have placeholder Instances for
      everywhere we'll want to show the raster, all pointing to another Instance tree responsible for rendering into
      the raster. These are known as <strong>shared caches</strong>, which are separate from
      <strong>Instance caches</strong>, which have a separate raster for every Instance.
    </p>

    <h2>Drawables</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Drawables</strong> are objects that can be displayed with a specific renderer. For example, a
      <a href="../doc#rectangle">Rectangle</a> can be displayed with a SVG-specific drawable. All
      drawables for a specific renderer (Canvas, WebGL, SVG, or DOM currently) conform to renderer-specific APIs
      (for instance, SVG drawables must have an svgElement property holding the actual SVG element, among other things).
    </p>

    <p>
      A node is called <strong>Painted</strong> if it displays something itself (like <a href="../doc#path">Path</a>,
      <a href="../doc#image">Image</a>, <a href="../doc#text">Text</a>, etc.). A vanilla <a href="../doc#node">Node</a>
      is not considered painted, since it doesn't display anything itself (even though its children/descendants may).
      Painted nodes will always have Instances that have <strong>self drawables</strong> that are responsible for
      rendering that node (not including any children).
    </p>

    <p>
      Some Instances will also have a <strong>group drawable</strong> that is responsible for combining the drawables
      of its descendant Instances and if available its self drawable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Drawables keep a reference to their parent and children (if applicable), creating an implicit
      <strong>drawable tree</strong>. This tree can be traversed in depth-first order to <em>repaint</em> any changed
      drawables before repainting their parents.
    </p>

    <h2>Blocks</h2>

    <p>
      A <strong>Block</strong> is a DOM-compatible drawable that is responsible for displaying a list of drawables
      with the same renderer (e.g. SVGBlock is responsible for displaying a bunch of SVG drawables and providing the
      &lt;svg&gt; element to be put in the DOM). Drawables can be added, removed, or rearranged inside of a block.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many types of blocks are <strong>fitted</strong>, indicating that the area they take up on the screen can be
      reduced to approximately "fit" the content (which can reduce browser memory usage and increase performance).
    </p>

    <h2>Backbones</h2>

    <p>
      A <strong>backbone</strong> is a type of DOM drawable that contains blocks as children. It is responsible for
      taking a list of drawables with (usually) differing renderers, splitting it into chunks that each have
      drawables with the same renderer, and managing blocks to handle each chunk. In the DOM, a backbone is a
      &lt;div&gt; that contains the DOM elements of its blocks as children.
    </p>

    <p>
      Certain types of Instances will contain a backbone as their group drawable. The root Instance will always have
      a backbone, known as the <strong>root backbone</strong>. The Display's
      <a href="../doc#display-domElement">domElement</a> is the root backbone's DOM element.
    </p>

    <h2>Visual Example</h2>

    <p>
      Below shows the transformation of an example node DAG into Instance trees, the drawable tree, and final DOM
      structure. In the example, the CSS transform hint results in the creation of a backbone (a div to transform),
      and both Instance and shared caches are shown ("cache" denoting the Instance caches).
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="../assets/ohtwo-design-notes.svg">
    </p>

    <h2>Batching</h2>

    <p>
      Scenery (since 0.2) is designed to generally batch all changes to the DOM until Display's
      <a href="../doc#display-updateDisplay">updateDisplay()</a> is called (where all visual operations are done).
      Input events are generally not batched (but executed synchronously), allowing writing security-sensitive
      event handlers directly in up-events.
    </p>

    <h2>Renderers</h2>

    <p>
      {Renderer} indicates a specific integer bitmask that includes a flag for DOM/SVG/Canvas/WebGL, and other
      optional flags. Use strict equality for comparison, or <code>Renderer.isDOM( renderer )</code> and equivalents.
    </p>

    <h2>Stitching</h2>

    <p>
      The task of updating blocks in a backbone for a new list of drawables is known as <strong>stitching</strong>.
      The back-propagation of syncTree() creates a list of {ChangeInterval}s that each conceptually contain a list of
      removed nodes and a list of added nodes (which are swapped in the list of drawables). Stitching needs to
      efficiently make changes at each ChangeInterval, inserting, removing and rearranging blocks to minimize the
      overall cost. See Stitcher.js for in-depth documentation on the constrains and process.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="../assets/stitch.svg">
    </p>

    <h2>Visibility</h2>

    <p>
      Node visibility is tracked by Instances. Every frame in the pre-repaint phase (after syncTree/stitching but before
      SVG updates and Canvas/WebGL repaints) the visibility flags (visible, relativeVisible, selfVisible) are updated
      for every Instance (lazily, so if a subtree doesn't need updates, it won't be updated). Drawable has a visibility
      flag for the drawable tree (if false, it and its sub-tree won't be drawn). SelfDrawable takes care of updating
      the visibility based on the Instance's selfVisibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      Drawables with the DOM renderer need to handle their own visibility
      (DOMSelfDrawable takes care of it with instance.selfVisible). Drawables with the SVG renderer don't have to handle
      visibility, each SVGGroup takes care of it. Canvas/WebGL rely on the instance/drawable visibility flags for
      whether to render in each pass.
    </p>

    <p>
      The excludeInvisible flag is provided to prevent drawables from an invisible subtree being included in its parent's
      drawable list. Thus if excludeInvisible === true AND the node itself for that is invisible, its drawables will NOT
      be included in the backbone or any blocks. If excludeInvisible === false then the drawables will be included, and
      the above methods for handling visibility for each renderer type will be used instead.
    </p>

    <h2 id="pickability">Pickability</h2>

    <p>
      Below is a worked example showing how the pickable flag, input listeners and visibility affect hit-testing, and
      also how _subtreePickableCount is used to efficiently maintain information on whether a pickable:true flag or
      input listener is in a visible descendant.
