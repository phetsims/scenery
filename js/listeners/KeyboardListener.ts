/**
 * A listener for general keyboard input. Specify the keys with a `keys` option in a readable format that looks like
 * this: [ 'shift+t', 'alt+shift+r' ]
 *
 * - Each entry in the array represents a "group" of keys.
 * - '+' separates each key in a single group.
 * - The keys leading up to the last key in the group are considered "modifier" keys. The last key in the group needs
 *   to be pressed while the modifier keys are down.
 * - ONLY the keys in the group can be pressed down. If any other keys are pressed the callback will not fire.
 * - The order modifier keys are pressed does not matter for firing the callback.
 *
 * In the above example "shift+t" OR "alt+shift+r" will fire the callback when pressed.
 *
 * An example usage would like this:
 *
 * this.addInputListener( new KeyboardListener( {
 *   keys: [ 'a+b', 'a+c', 'shift+arrowLeft', 'alt+g+t', 'ctrl+3', 'alt+ctrl+t' ],
 *   callback: ( event, listener ) => {
 *     const keysPressed = listener.keysPressed;
 *
 *     if ( keysPressed === 'a+b' ) {
 *       console.log( 'you just pressed a+b!' );
 *     }
 *     else if ( keysPressed === 'a+c' ) {
 *       console.log( 'you just pressed a+c!' );
 *     }
 *     else if ( keysPressed === 'alt+g+t' ) {
 *       console.log( 'you just pressed alt+g+t' );
 *     }
 *     else if ( keysPressed === 'ctrl+3' ) {
 *       console.log( 'you just pressed ctrl+3' );
 *     }
 *     else if ( keysPressed === 'shift+arrowLeft' ) {
 *       console.log( 'you just pressed shift+arrowLeft' );
 *     }
 *   }
 * } ) );
 *
 * By default the callback will fire when the last key is pressed down. See additional options for firing on key
 * up or other press and hold behavior.
