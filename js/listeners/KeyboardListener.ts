/**
 * A listener for general keyboard input. Specify the keys with a `keys` option in a readable format that looks like
 * this: [ 'shift+t', 'alt+shift+r' ]
 *
 * - Each entry in the array represents a combination of keys that must be pressed to fire a callback.
 * - '+' separates each key in a single combination.
 * - The keys leading up to the last key in the combination are considered "modifier" keys. The last key in the
 *   combination needs to be pressed while the modifier keys are down to fire the callback.
 * - The order modifier keys are pressed does not matter for firing the callback.
 *
 * In the above example "shift+t" OR "alt+shift+r" will fire the callback when pressed.
 *
 * An example usage would like this:
 *
 * this.addInputListener( new KeyboardListener( {
 *   keys: [ 'a+b', 'a+c', 'shift+arrowLeft', 'alt+g+t', 'ctrl+3', 'alt+ctrl+t' ],
 *   fire: ( event, keysPressed, listener ) => {
 *     if ( keysPressed === 'a+b' ) {
 *       console.log( 'you just pressed a+b!' );
 *     }
 *     else if ( keysPressed === 'a+c' ) {
 *       console.log( 'you just pressed a+c!' );
 *     }
 *     else if ( keysPressed === 'alt+g+t' ) {
 *       console.log( 'you just pressed alt+g+t' );
 *     }
 *     else if ( keysPressed === 'ctrl+3' ) {
 *       console.log( 'you just pressed ctrl+3' );
 *     }
 *     else if ( keysPressed === 'shift+arrowLeft' ) {
 *       console.log( 'you just pressed shift+arrowLeft' );
 *     }
 *   }
 * } ) );
 *
 * By default, the fire callback will fire when the last key is pressed down. See additional options for firing on key
 * release or other press and hold behavior.
 *
 * **Important Modifier Key Behavior**
 * Modifier keys prevent other key combinations from firing their behavior if they are pressed down.
 * For example, if you have a listener with 'shift+t' and 'y', pressing 'shift' will prevent 'y' from firing.
 * This behavior matches the behavior of the browser and is intended to prevent unexpected behavior. However,
 * this behavior is also true for custom (non-standard) modifier keys. For example, if you have a listener with
 * 'j+t' and 'y', pressing 'j' will prevent 'y' from firing. This is a PhET specific design decision, but it
 * is consistent with typical modifier key behavior.
 *
 * **Ignored Modifier Keys**
 * You can specify modifier keys that should be ignored while the hotkey is active. This allows you to override
 * default modifier key behavior. For example, if you have a listener for the 'y' key and you want it to
 * trigger even when the shift key is pressed, you would add 'shift' to the ignored modifier keys list.
 *
 * Ignored modifier keys are indicated in the key string using the '?' character. You can also choose to ignore
 * all other modifier keys by placing the '?' before the modifier key. Here are some examples:
 *
 * 'shift?+y' - fires when 'y' is pressed, even if 'shift' is down.
 * '?shift+y' - fires when 'y' and shift are pressed, but also allows 'ctrl', 'alt', or 'meta' to be down.
 *
 * **Global Keyboard Listeners**
 * A KeyboardListener can be added to a Node with addInputListener, and it will fire with normal scenery input dispatch
 * behavior when the Node has focus. However, a KeyboardListener can also be added "globally", meaning it will fire
 * regardless of where focus is in the document. Use KeyboardListener.createGlobal. This adds Hotkeys to the
 * globalHotkeyRegistry. Be sure to dispose of the KeyboardListener when it is no longer needed.
 *
 * **Potential Pitfall!**
 * The fire callback is only called if exactly the keys in a group are pressed. If you need to listen to a modifier key,
 * you must include it in the keys array. For example if you add a listener for 'tab', you must ALSO include
 * 'shift+tab' in the array to observe 'shift+tab' presses. If you provide 'tab' alone, the callback will not fire
 * if 'shift' is also pressed.
 *
 * Beware of "key ghosting". Some key combinations are not possible on certain keyboards. For example, some keyboards
 * cannot press all arrow keys at the same time. Be sure to test your key combinations on a variety of keyboards.
 * See https://github.com/phetsims/scenery/issues/1655.
