/**
 * A listener for common button usage, providing the fire() method/callback and helpful properties. NOTE that it doesn't
 * need to be an actual button (or look like a button), this is useful whenever that type of "fire" behavior is helpful.
 *
 * For example usage, see scenery/examples/input.html. Usually you can just pass a fire callback and things work.
