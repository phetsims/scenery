/**
 * A Scenery event is an abstraction over incoming user DOM events.
 *
 * It provides more information (particularly Scenery-related information), and handles a single pointer at a time
 * (DOM TouchEvents can include information for multiple touches at the same time, so the TouchEvent can be passed to
 * multiple Scenery events). Thus it is not save to assume that the DOM event is unique, as it may be shared.
 *
 * NOTE: While the event is being dispatched, its currentTarget may be changed. It is not fully immutable.
