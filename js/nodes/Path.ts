   *
   * The valid parameter types are:
   * - Shape: (from Kite), normally used.
   * - string: Uses the SVG Path format, see https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html (the PATH part of <path d="PATH"/>).

   *           Shape object instead of the original string.
   * - null: Indicates that there is no Shape, and nothing is drawn. Usually used as a placeholder.
   *
   * NOTE: Be aware of the potential for memory leaks. If a Shape is not marked as immutable (with makeImmutable()),
   *       Path will add a listener so that it is updated when the Shape itself changes. If there is a listener
   *       added, keeping a reference to the Shape will also keep a reference to the Path object (and thus whatever
