/**
 * A node which always fills the entire screen, no matter what the transform is.
 * Used for showing an overlay on the screen e.g., when a popup dialog is shown.
 * This can fade the background to focus on the dialog/popup as well as intercept mouse events for dismissing the dialog/popup.
 * Note: This is currently implemented using large numbers, it should be rewritten to work in any coordinate frame, possibly using phet.kite.Shape.plane()
 * TODO: Implement using infinite geometry https://github.com/phetsims/scenery/issues/1581
