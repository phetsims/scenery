/**
 * A focus highlight for the voicing prototype. Has a unique color to indicate that focus is not around something
 * that is interactive, but can be read with activation.
 *
 * This should generally be used for otherwise NON interactive things that have voicing. Normally focusable things
 * should have the default focus highlight.
