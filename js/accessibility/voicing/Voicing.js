/**
 * A trait for Node that supports the Voicing feature, under accessibility. Allows you to define responses for the Node
 * and make requests to speak that content using HTML5 SpeechSynthesis and the UtteranceQueue. Voicing content is
 * organized into four categories which are responsible for describing different things. Output of this content
 * can be controlled by the responseCollector. These include the
 *
 * - "Name" response: The name of the object that uses Voicing. Similar to the "Accessible Name" in web accessibility.
 * - "Object" response: The state information about the object that uses Voicing.
 * - "Context" response: The contextual changes that result from interaction with the Node that uses Voicing.
 * - "Hint" response: A supporting hint that guides the user toward a desired interaction with this Node.
 *
 * See the property and setter documentation for each of these responses for more information.
 *
 * Once this content is set, you can make a request to speak it using an UtteranceQueue with one of the provided
 * functions in this Trait. It is up to you to call one of these functions when you wish for speech to be made. The only
 * exception is on the 'focus' event. Every Node that composes Voicing will speak its responses by when it
 * receives focus.
