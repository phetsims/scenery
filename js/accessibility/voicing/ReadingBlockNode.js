/**
 * A Node that is composed with ReadingBlock.
 *
 * // REVIEW: Sounds good! That said, I see usages in JT, which is soon to be going out for production, https://github.com/phetsims/scenery/issues/1223
 * WARNING: Under active development, not ready for production. This is sort of trying out
 * inheritance for ReadingBlock/Voicing by composing into a base type to be extended by other
 * Nodes. If this is clean, maybe ReadingBlock and Voicing should be made classes rather than
 * traits.
 *
 * // REVIEW: I'm pretty confused by this type, ReadingBlock is overwriting the tagName, so what is this type doing? https://github.com/phetsims/scenery/issues/1223
