/**
 * Manages the Properties which signify and control where various forms of focus are. A Focus
 * just contains the Trail pointing to the Node with focus and a Display whose root is at the
 * root of that Trail. So it can be used for more than just DOM focus. At the time of this writing,
 * the forms of Focus include
 *
 *  - DOM Focus - The Focus Trail points to the Node whose element has DOM focus in the Parallel DOM.
 *                Only one element can have focus at a time (DOM limitation) so this is managed by a static on
 *                FocusManager.
 *  - Pointer Focus - The Focus trail points to a Node that supports Highlighting with pointer events.
 *  - Reading Block Focus - The Focus Trail points to a Node that supports ReadingBlocks, and is active
 *                          while the ReadingBlock content is being spoken for Voicing. See ReadingBlock.js
 *
 * There may be other forms of Focus in the future.
 *
 * This class also controls setting and clearing of several (but not all) of these Properties. It does not set the
 * pdomFocusProperty because that Property is set only when the browser's focus changes. Some of the focus
 * Properties are set in feature traits, such as pointerFocusProperty which is set by MouseHighlighting because it is
 * set through listeners on each individual Node.
 *
 * This class also has a few Properties that control the behavior of the Display's HighlightOverlay.
